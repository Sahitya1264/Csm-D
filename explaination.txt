This Python program is a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to guess the number, and after each guess, the program tells them if their guess is too low, too high, or correct. It also checks to make sure the input is a valid number. The game keeps track of how many guesses the user makes and ends when the user guesses the correct number, displaying the total attempts taken. This interactive loop continues until the right number is found, providing a fun and simple guessing challenge.
